# webdevelope
First project on my github.
This is the first case in my career, including the front-end interface and back-end management. 
Here I will show a part of it as one of my projects. 
This is a back-end interface created by myself, which can be used to connect to other pages required by the back-end. 
Hope to provide some inspiration for web beginners, if there is something wrong, please correct me.
